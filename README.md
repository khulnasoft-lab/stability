# Stability Markers

Stability Markers are convenient labels for your project. They tell your
users how stable and active your particular project is.

There are five stability markers:

- [Experimental](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/stability/experimental.html): Not considered ready for prime-time usage
- [Active](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/stability/active.html): At least one stable release and planned feature releases.
- [Sustained](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/stability/sustained.html): One or more stable releases, mature, and "feature complete".
- [Maintenance](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/stability/maintenance.html): Stable releases, but only infrequent bug fixing releases.
- [Unsupported](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/stability/unsupported.html): No longer developed.

See [the main page](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/stability) for more.
